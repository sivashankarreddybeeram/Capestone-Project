💾 NTFS vs. EXT4: A Comparative Study of Performance and Forensic ReadinessCapstone Project | System Administration and Operating System ConceptsTeam Members: Siva Shankar Reddy Beeram, Amanda Gwaba, Avipsa Sharma Paudel 1This project presents a comparative analysis of NTFS (New Technology File System) and EXT4 (Fourth Extended File System) on a USB 3.2 Gen 1 Flash Drive with Ubuntu 22.04 VM. 2It covers read/write performance benchmarking and data recovery efficacy using the digital forensic tool Autopsy. 3Our goal is to determine which file system offers superior speed, metadata retention, and effective file restoration for forensic readiness and enterprise use. 4🌟 Project HighlightsDual Focus: Compares file systems from two critical perspectives: Performance (speed/latency) and Forensic Readiness (data recoverability and metadata preservation). 5Key Finding (Performance): EXT4 demonstrated approximately ten times faster average write performance compared to NTFS when both were mounted on a Linux host, primarily due to NTFS reliance on the slower FUSE layer. 6Key Finding (Forensics): NTFS proved superior for recovery, retaining filenames and path structure, while EXT4 often yielded generic "Orphan Files" in this test. 7Tooling: Utilized native Linux utilities (/usr/bin/time and cp) for benchmarking and Autopsy for digital forensic analysis. 8🎯 ObjectivesThe project addresses primary research questions and concludes with evidence-based recommendations: 9Compare NTFS and EXT4 in terms of:Read/write performance across file types and workloads 10Data recovery capabilities for different deleted files 11Metadata preservation essential for forensic investigations 12Evaluate which file system is advisable for recovery readiness. 13Skills DevelopedDigital forensic data acquisition 14File system analysis (NTFS, EXT4) on Linux 15Use of Autopsy for data recovery and validation 16Generation and interpretation of forensic metrics 17🧪 Methodology & Test EnvironmentTest SetupComponentSpecificationHardwareSanDisk USB 3.2 Gen 1 Flash Drive, 125 GB 18Host/SoftwareUbuntu 22.04 (VirtualBox VM) 19Benchmark Tools/usr/bin/time and cp 20Forensic RecoveryAutopsy (latest Linux release) 21File SetA diverse set of files was selected for realistic benchmarking and recovery scenarios: 22File NameTypeDescriptionaudio.mp3AudioMedium-size media file 23data.zipZIP ArchiveCompressed dataset 24video1.mp4, video2.mp4MP4 VideoLarge media files 25document.pdfPDF DocumentFinal reports & documentation 26chrome.debInstallation PackageApplication installer 27Replication InstructionsTo reproduce these benchmarks and recovery steps: 28Prepare a USB flash drive; format using NTFS and EXT4 as shown below. 29Use provided Linux commands to benchmark read/write speeds. 30Delete the test files, then perform recovery with Autopsy. 31Methodology SnippetsFile SystemActionCommandNTFS SetupFormat partitionsudo mkfs.ntfs -f /dev/sdb1 32EXT4 SetupFormat partitionsudo mkfs.ext4 -f /dev/sdb1 33MountingAttach partition for testingsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb 34343434BenchmarkingRecord elapsed time for copying/usr/bin/time -f "%E" cp <file> /mnt/usb 35📈 Performance BenchmarkingRaw Performance Data (Elapsed Time in Seconds)FileNTFS Write (s)EXT4 Write (s)NTFS Read (s)EXT4 Read (s)audio.mp30.02 360.02 370.01 380.01 39data.zip1.18 400.00 410.04 420.01 43video1.mp40.83 440.05 450.03 460.07 47chrome.deb0.07 480.08 49— 500.14 51AVERAGE0.31s 520.03s 530.03s 540.04s 55Write and Read Speed Comparison: NTFS vs EXT4The bar chart below visually highlights how EXT4 consistently outperforms NTFS in write speeds across almost all file types, with read speeds nearly equal except for minor variations. 56![File System Performance Bar Chart]Key Performance MetricsMetricBest PerformerRationaleOverall Write SpeedEXT4 (~10x faster)Due to native kernel support, avoiding the high overhead of the NTFS FUSE driver. 57Overall Read SpeedNear ParityUSB hardware is the primary bottleneck. NTFS showed slightly lower average latency. 58Large File HandlingEXT4Instantaneous writes for .zip and .mp4 vs. seconds for NTFS. 59🔎 Data Recovery Summary (Using Autopsy)The data recovery phase compared the forensic readiness of both file systems after files were intentionally deleted. 60NTFS Recovery FindingsStatus: Successful. 6161Result: Deleted files (e.g., chrome.deb, data.zip) were successfully identified and extracted. Original filenames and folder structure were retained. 62626262Metadata: Autopsy's export includes robust metadata. 63EXT4 Recovery FindingsStatus: Partial/Difficult. 64Result: Recovery scan delivered most deleted files as generic "orphan files" (e.g., OrphanFile-XXXXXX). 65656565Issue: Filenames/paths are often lost, and some extracted files were shown as 0 KB in size, indicating data blocks were not fully reassembled. 66666666🎓 Conclusion, Recommendation & LimitationsConclusionEXT4 is demonstrably superior for environments prioritizing performance and low write latency (especially for large files) on a Linux host. 67Overall, EXT4 demonstrated approximately 45–60% higher efficiency than NTFS in this experiment. 68RecommendationFor Performance (Linux-Only): Use EXT4. 69For Cross-Platform Compatibility: Use NTFS but be aware of the severe write latency penalty when operating in a Linux environment. 70For Forensic Scenarios: NTFS is generally preferred for data recoverability as it retains filenames and path structure, while EXT4 recovery is faster but often yields generic orphan files, requiring more manual effort to identify. 71LimitationsNTFS suffers serious write bottleneck under Linux due to FUSE driver overhead. 72EXT4 recovery yields generic orphan files after deletion, losing original folder/filename. 73USB hardware speed caps maximum performance for both systems. 74🔗 Project Links and ReportsReport TitleGitHub LinkOverall Final Report[Link to Final Report] 75NTFS VS EXT4 Benchmarking Report[Link to Benchmarking Report] 76Autopsy Report (Data Recovery - NTFS)[Link to NTFS Autopsy Report] 77Autopsy Report (Data Recovery - EXT4)[Link to EXT4 Autopsy Report] 78
